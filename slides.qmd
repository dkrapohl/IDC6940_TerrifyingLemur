# Introduction {#sec-introduction}

## Background and Motivation {#sec-background}

Discuss the challenge of predicting stock market movements and the practical implications for portfolio management, risk assessment, and trading strategies. Explain why traditional time series methods alone may be insufficient and how machine learning approaches offer complementary strengths.

## Research Problem {#sec-problem}

Articulate the core research question: Can Random Forest models enhanced with time series-derived features improve prediction accuracy for 20-day S&P 500 directional movements compared to traditional approaches? Address the specific challenge that Random Forest models lack inherent temporal memory.

## Research Objectives {#sec-objectives}

State specific goals: (1) Develop a hybrid methodology combining ARMA feature engineering with Random Forest classification, (2) Identify optimal lag structures and moving average windows through systematic time series analysis, (3) Evaluate model performance using multiple metrics, (4) Determine feature importance for market direction prediction.

## Significance of Study {#sec-significance}

Explain the theoretical contribution to the literature on hybrid forecasting models and practical value for quantitative finance practitioners. Emphasize the novelty of your systematic approach to time series feature engineering for ensemble learning methods.

## Scope and Limitations {#sec-scope}

Define the temporal scope (1990-2024), geographic focus (U.S. markets via S&P 500), prediction horizon (20-day directional movement), and acknowledge limitations such as market regime changes, transaction costs not modeled, and the binary classification constraint.

$$G = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{C} p_i^2$$ {#eq-gini}

where $G$ is the Gini impurity measure at the node, $C$ is the number of classes, and $p_i$ is the proportion of samples in the node that belong to class $i$.

## Random Forest Algorithm Pseudocode

```
for b = 1 to B:

        At each node:
            Randomly select m features from p total features
            Choose best split among these m features
            Split node into two child nodes
        Continue until minimum node size reached

    Aggregate predictions from all B trees (majority vote for classification)
```

Explain hypothesis testing for unit roots and implications for modeling.

### Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation {#sec-theory-acf}

where $\phi_i$ are autoregressive coefficients and $\theta_j$ are moving average coefficients. Discuss identification through ACF/PACF patterns.

### Model Selection Criteria {#sec-theory-criteria}

Derive and explain information criteria:

$$AIC = 2k - 2\ln(\hat{L})$$ {#eq-aic}
